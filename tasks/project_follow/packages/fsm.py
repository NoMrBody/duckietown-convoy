"""Follower-bot finite state machine: pure pursuit of the lead's circle-grid
back marker, with a lane-following fallback. No traffic-sign logic at all -- the
lead owns that. The follower stops *implicitly* when the lead halts (the grid
grows -> distance taper -> speed 0).

States:
  WAIT_LEAD  - startup: hold until the lead has opened a gap (don't lurch into a
               stationary lead at boot).
  FOLLOW     - marker present: distance-tapered speed, steer toward the marker.
  CLOSE_STOP - marker lost while close: STOP (don't coast into the lead).
  REACQUIRE  - marker lost within grace: slow creep + steer toward the last-seen
               bearing, to turn *into* the corner the lead took.
  PURSUIT_TURN - ("turn" corner_mode only) the marker swept sideways out of
               view: the lead turned a corner. Drive straight to where it
               vanished, execute our own ~90 deg turn in the observed
               direction (closed on pose odometry), then resume following.
               Needs odometry, so it is the sim default; the real bot uses
               the "lane" corner_mode below instead.
  LANE_FOLLOW- marker lost: cruise on the lane (it IS the leader's path). In the
               default "lane" corner_mode the steering is biased toward the
               remembered turn direction for a short commit window, so the bot
               commits to the corner the leader took instead of dead-reckoning a
               blind arc, until the leader is re-seen.
  HOLD       - nothing visible for longer than the pursuit window: stop.
               (While the window is open, an unhealthy lane creeps on as
               REACQUIRE instead of parking — corners flicker lane health.)

Pure logic over a WorldModel -> unit-testable without vision/hardware.
